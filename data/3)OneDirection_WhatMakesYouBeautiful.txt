"What Makes You Beautiful" (often abbreviated as WMYB) is the debut single by the British-Irish boy band One Direction. It was the lead single from their debut album, Up All Night (2011). Written by Savan Kotecha and producer Rami Yacoub, the song was released by Syco Records on 11 September 2011. The uptempo power pop[1] track features a prominent guitar-based chorus and riff. The middle eight consists of a "na na na" hook.

"What Makes You Beautiful" was a commercial success, reaching number one in several countries. It has been certified quadruple platinum in the US with sales of 4.8 million copies as of June 2016.[3] The single peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the UK Singles Chart. The song won the 2012 Brit Award for British Single of the Year and was generally complimented by contemporary music critics, who highlighted the appeal to the teenage audience and the pop sensibility. It debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart after setting a Sony Music Entertainment pre-order record and selling 153,965 copies in its first week. The single topped the Irish and Scottish Singles Charts, and reached the top ten on the Australian and New Zealand Singles Charts, Flemish Ultratop 50, Canadian Hot 100, and the Japan Hot 100.

The song's accompanying music video, directed by John Urbano, was uploaded to YouTube on 19 August 2011. It depicts One Direction spending time on a beach in Malibu, California. The video garnered three MTV Video Music Awards at the 2012 ceremony. One Direction performed the song live on televised shows, at awards ceremonies, and on all four of their headlining concert tours: Up All Night Tour (2011–12), Take Me Home Tour (2013), Where We Are Tour (2014), and On the Road Again Tour (2015); band member Harry Styles performed the song on his 2017 and 2021 solo tours. Many artists have covered the song, including the Piano Guys, Boyce Avenue, and Enhypen. It is often regarded as One Direction's signature song, and one of the most iconic and recognisable pop songs of the 2010s.

Background and production
"What Makes You Beautiful" was written by Savan Kotecha and Carl Falk and produced by Yacoub and Falk. Instrumentation was completed by Falk and Yacoub. Serban Ghenea handled the audio mixing, Tom Coyne the audio mastering, and John Hanes the mix engineering, for which Phil Seaford served as the assistant.[4] Discussing the song's conception, Kotecha said:

I had the melody of the chorus in my song for about a year until I was in a hotel room in London with my wife and she was having a bad morning. She was like, "Oh, I feel so ugly" and I was like, "No, you look beautiful. You don't know how beautiful you look." And I was like, "Oh, crap! That's a good song! Hold on!" And I wrote that down. I actually wrote the song for my wife, so I went to the studio and it took a process of a couple weeks to really tweak it, but the core of it was written within two days and then tweaked a few things here and there over a couple weeks, but I mean, I still have the text message from Harry [Styles]. When he heard the demo, I was in Miami on my way back to Sweden, and he sent me a text message saying, "I think you got it. I think you got the one here."[5]

After recording the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden,[4] the band felt relieved to have a song that they were happy to release as their debut single. Band member Liam Payne called the song "perfect",[6] and Harry Styles said, "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single."[7] Styles spoke to MTV News, "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun. It kind of represented us, I think it took us a while to find it but I think we found the right song." Payne added, "We always wanted [the single] to be something that people didn't expect and then when we heard it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly."[8]

Release and promotion
"What Makes You Beautiful" premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 10 August 2011,[7] and was released by Syco Music in Europe, Australia and New Zealand via digital download on 11 September 2011.[9] A CD single was released in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2011,[10] and followed in Australia and Germany on 25 November 2011 and 2 December 2011, respectively.[11][12] In North America, the single was released in Canada via digital download on 31 January 2012.[13] It was issued 14 February 2012 in the United States[14] and was sent by Columbia Records to US contemporary hit radio (CHR) playlists on 28 February 2012.[15]

For the North American release of Up All Night on 13 March 2012, Columbia Records executives used social media to shape the marketing campaign. Columbia Records co-chairman Steve Barnett and his team decided to reverse the usual pattern of releasing a single on radio. Instead the label mounted a four-month marketing campaign aimed at building a fan base through social media before a single was ever released or played on the radio. The social media campaign asked fans to sign petitions and to enter video competitions to win a concert in their town. The campaign was a success as One Direction's Facebook followers in the United States rose from 40,000 to 400,000. As a result, "What Makes You Beautiful" sold more than 131,000 copies in its first week, even though it had yet to be played on the radio. Radio programmers were flooded with calls from fans. Johnny Wright, who managed New Kids on the Block, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, said: "Now they are calling the radio station, and the radio station is scratching its head, saying, "We don't even have that record yet". It's almost like the return of the Beatles. I call it hype, but it's positive hype because it's all real. It's not manufactured. No one paid these kids."[16]

Composition
"What Makes You Beautiful" is a power pop song,[1] with electropop influences.[17] Running for 3 minutes and 23 seconds, the song is set in common time with a tempo of 125 beats per minute. Written in the key of E major, it follows the chord progression E–A–B; vocal elements range from the note of B2 to G♯4.[18] James C. McKinley Jr. of The New York Times compared its chord progression to "La Bamba".[19] The opening guitar riff has been noted as similar to that of "Summer Nights" from the musical Grease.[20] "What Makes You Beautiful" has a guitar-based chorus whose notes range from C to E; Digital Spy's Robert Copsey likened it to a cross between Pink's "Raise Your Glass" and McFly's "All About You".[20] It also contains cowbell instrumentation,[21] and the middle eight consists of an "oh na na na" hook.[22]

Critical reception
The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave "What Makes You Beautiful" four out of five stars, praising its catchy melody and summarising it as "adorable, completely innocent and bound to cause a stir amongst your mates".[20] Zachary Houle of PopMatters called the song a "nice get-up-and-go dance number."[21] Ailbhe Malone of NME commended the song's appeal to the teenage audience and its chord progression for being "simple enough to be played on an acoustic guitar at a house party."[22] Newsround called it "fun, upbeat and incredibly catchy."[23] AllMusic's Matthew Chisling called it an "effervescent and fresh tween love song", and chose it as one of the best tracks on Up All Night.[24] Sophie Goddard from Cosmopolitan called the single "ridiculously catchy".[25] Student's Jack Murray rated "What Makes You Beautiful" five out of five stars and called it "not only the best pop single of the year so far, but potentially of any X Factor contestant ever". Murray lauded the songwriting and light production.[26] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly awarded "What Makes You Beautiful" a B+ grade, calling the song "shallow but crushworthy", writing that the song shows that boy bands are not dying out.[27]

Lipshutz noted its "cheeky electro-pop twist".[28] Stephanie Abrahams of TIME assessed, "The group takes cues from the boy bands of yesteryear with bubblegum lyrics about young love — "The way you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed" they croon in their breakout single – which any parent can get behind. That's a far cry from a typical Nicki Minaj verse."[29] The Observer editor Kitty Empire wrote in an assessment, "With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive."[30] "What Makes You Beautiful" won the BRIT Award for Best British Single at the 2012 Brit Awards, which was held on 21 February 2012.[31] The song also won the Teen Choice Award for Choice Music: Love Song at the 2012 Teen Choice Awards.[32] Newsround called the song "fun, upbeat and incredibly catchy" while commenting "there's no way these boys won't be a hit".[33]
