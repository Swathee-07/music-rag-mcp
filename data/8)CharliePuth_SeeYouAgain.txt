"See You Again" is a song by American rapper Wiz Khalifa featuring American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth. Produced by Puth, DJ Frank E and Andrew Cedar, who also co-wrote the song with Khalifa, the song was commissioned for the soundtrack of the 2015 film Furious 7 as a tribute to Fast & Furious actor Paul Walker, who died in a single-vehicle crash on November 30, 2013. The song was released on March 10, 2015, as the soundtrack's lead single. It was later included as a bonus track on the international release of Puth's debut album, Nine Track Mind (2016).

"See You Again" became both artists' biggest single to date. It spent 12 non-consecutive weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100, tying with Eminem's "Lose Yourself" for the second longest-running rap number-one single in the country behind Lil Nas X's "Old Town Road", and topped the UK Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks.[2] It also reached number one in several other countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and Switzerland. The song held the record for the most-streamed track in a single day on Spotify in the United States, until it was surpassed by One Direction's "Drag Me Down".[3] It set the record for most streams in a single week worldwide, and in the United Kingdom also in a single week.

The music video was the most-viewed video on YouTube from July 10 to August 4, 2017. "See You Again" received three nominations at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Song Written for Visual Media. It was also shortlisted for the Song of the Year for the BBC Music Awards and was nominated for Best Original Song at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.[4] "See You Again" was the best selling-song of 2015 worldwide, with combined sales and track-equivalent streams of 20.9 million units according to IFPI.[5] It is certified Diamond by the RIAA,[6] and is one of the most-streamed songs on Spotify ever, with over 2.1 billion streams.[7]

Writing and development
"See You Again" was written by DJ Frank E, Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa, and Andrew Cedar. It was produced by DJ Frank E, Charlie Puth, and Andrew Cedar,[8] with mixing provided by Manny Marroquin. Frank E and Puth were approached by their publishing company, Artist Publishing Group, to develop a melody that could pay tribute to actor Paul Walker for the film Furious 7 (2015); Artist Publishing Group then set up a first-time studio session for Puth with DJ Frank E at a studio in Los Angeles.[9]

Puth, talking about the first studio session for the song, said that when he went to the studio "[the producers] were working on this song" and it already had the "See You Again" chords, but it was a "synthy" production for a "dance song", and he later suggested the idea of the song being a piano ballad instead.[10] Puth said that he became emotionally attached while writing the lyrics of the track, recalling Vail Cerullo, a friend of Puth's from his time at Berklee College of Music, who died in a motorcycle accident in 2012.[11][12] Puth and DJ Frank E's output from the session was well received by Furious 7 filmmakers, Universal Pictures, and Atlantic. As a result, the track was further commissioned to include rapped verses based on the subject of family, combined with Puth's vocals and a piano melody. The song then went through an extensive note-giving and production process.[13] Before choosing Wiz Khalifa's version, several other rappers were offered to record the rapped parts of the song, including Eminem, 50 Cent and Tyga.[14][15][16] Puth said that he was initially reluctant to let the film's soundtrack label, Atlantic Records, choose his vocals for the song. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Puth recalled, "It just seemed to occur from out of nowhere. And basically 10 minutes later Justin (Franks [DJ Frank E]) and I wrote it, we sent it off, and I thought we'd never hear about it again".[13] Puth revealed on The Howard Stern Show that Atlantic originally wanted to get a more established singer to sing his part, having Chris Brown, Sam Smith, Jason Derulo and others recording their own versions of the song's chorus. Puth stated that also British singer Adele "wanted to cut it". According to Puth, "none of the vocals had the [right] feeling ... What I was singing about specifically, you just couldn't hear it in their voice. I think Chris Brown got the closest to it, but they ended up, lucky me, going with my vocal".[10][17]

The song was chosen to be played at the end of the film. After Brian O'Conner's retirement send-off, the song can be heard as Brian and Dominic Toretto drive on a mountain road, parting ways as they reach a fork.[13]
