Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happier_Than_Ever_(album)


Happier Than Ever is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Billie Eilish, released by Darkroom and Interscope Records on July 30, 2021.
Eilish co-wrote the album with her brother and frequent collaborator Finneas O'Connell, who also produced the album and played every instrument.
Eilish cited self-reflection during the COVID-19 pandemic as the biggest inspiration for the record.
Primarily a downtempo pop record, Happier Than Ever is characterized by sparse, jazz-influenced, electropop arrangements set to meditative tempos, departing from the upbeat, trap-led sound of Eilish's debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?
(2019).
Consisting of torch songs about the downsides of stardom, Happier Than Ever draws heavily from Eilish's rise to fame and the drawbacks that come with it.
Upon release, the album received acclaim from music critics, who praised its stylistic, restrained production, and insightful lyrics.
At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, the album and its title track received a total of seven nominations, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.
Seven singles were released in promotion of the album: "My Future", "Therefore I Am", "Your Power", "Lost Cause", "NDA", the title track, and "Male Fantasy"; the first three peaked within the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100.
"Therefore I Am" was the highest-charting song from the album, peaking at number two, followed by "My Future" at number six, and "Your Power" at number 10.
Happier Than Ever debuted atop the Billboard 200 as Eilish's second number-one album in the United States, and topping the album charts in 27 other countries.
Eilish performed the album's tracks in the Disney+ concert film, Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles, which was released on September 3, 2021.
To further promote the album, Eilish embarked on her sixth concert tour, titled Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, which began on February 3, 2022, and concluded on April 2, 2023.
Background and recording
Eilish released her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?
(which was also produced by her brother Finneas O'Connell) on March 29, 2019.
[1] It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-topping single "Bad Guy", her first number-one on the chart.
[2] The album and the single helped Eilish win five awards at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, including the "big four" Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best New Artist.
[1] Eilish released a number of singles since the album: the stand-alone "Everything I Wanted" (2019), the James Bond theme song "No Time to Die" (2020), and the Rosalía collaboration "Lo Vas a Olvidar" (2021), the first two of which won Record of the Year and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 63rd Grammy Awards, respectively.
[3][2] In a January 2020 interview, Eilish stated she would begin working on her upcoming second studio album during the year.
[4] In March, Finneas confirmed this, stating that it would be "pretty pure in its intention" like Eilish's debut, with the two continuing to make the type of music they like to "play live".
[5] In January 2021, Eilish stated that the album "feels exactly how I want it to", with her not wanting to change a single thing about it.
Her documentary film, Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry, was released the following month.
[6] Later in February, Eilish announced the album would have 16 tracks.
[7]

Happier Than Ever was recorded at Finneas' home recording studio, located in the basement of his Los Angeles residence.
[8] According to Eilish, recording took place between April 1, 2020, and February 16, 2021, in weekly schedules, starting with "My Future" and ending with "Oxytocin".
[9][8] The title track was the first song she wrote from the record, dating back to the European leg of her When We All Fall Asleep Tour.
[8] Eilish revealed that all of 16 songs on the final track listing were the only songs the duo worked on during the album's creation,[8] yet there were two songs, namely "What I Wanna Hear" and "Born Blue", that were omitted from the record since she "just couldn't figure them out".
[9] In 2024, the singer released "Blue" as the concluding track of her next studio album Hit Me Hard and Soft, which is a mash-up of "Born Blue" and another unreleased song "True Blue".
[10]

Eilish has revealed that the creative process of Happier Than Ever felt "very natural", unlike her previous projects where she constantly felt anxious and under pressure.
[11] With earlier works, Eilish also felt that she was not good enough and simply was not talented, but has since gained much more confidence in her craft.
[12] According to Eilish, her record label did not have any input on the album,[13] unlike her debut album where she felt pressure from deadlines, constant meetings and "an expectation that a star was about to be born", all of which she "literally hated".
[8]

In an interview with Vevo, Eilish said that she wanted to create "a very timeless record", mostly being inspired by jazz singers that she listened to growing up such as Julie London, Peggy Lee and Frank Sinatra.
[11] She also said that the songs on the album are "all over the place and very, I think, versatile, different to one another, but also very cohesive," which she cited as one of her biggest goals.
[11] Another one of her goals she had during studio sessions was to surprise her fans as well as herself.
[14] She aimed to be uncomfortable during the creative process, using "NDA" as an example of a song that was not made in her "comfort zone".
[14] Eilish cited self-reflection as the biggest muse behind the record,[11] and revealed before its release that "almost none of the songs on this album are joyful", despite its title.
[8] She noted "Male Fantasy" as a song that "pretty much wrote itself" and helped her realize feelings she had not processed before.
[14]

Music and lyrics
Musically, Happier Than Ever is a subdued,[15] pop,[16] electropop,[17] downtempo,[18][19][20] and jazz-pop record,[20] incorporating elements of R&B, techno,[21] country, bossa nova,[17] bedroom pop,[22] trip hop,[23] folk,[24] electro, trap,[25] and 1990s sophisti-pop.
[26] It consists of torch songs set to slow tempos, with restrained,[26] minimalistic[22] arrangements of acoustic guitars, delicate synthesizers, and burbling beats.
[26] The lyrics deal with struggles faced by young women in the entertainment industry,[27] fame, stardom, emotional abuse, power struggles, mistrust,[8] and misogyny,[28] imbued by Eilish's self-consciousness.
[29] In Robert Christgau's opinion, Eilish's songwriting had inspired Finneas to devise a sound for the album that is "calmer and less sprightly" than her earlier breakthrough work.
[30]

Songs
The opening track, "Getting Older", is a song about abuse and was "particularly harrowing" to write.
[8] The song deals with sexual coercion.
[15] The second track, "I Didn't Change My Number", features a heavy beat.
[31] "Billie Bossa Nova", the third track, presents "a more mature side of Eilish".
[32] The fourth track, "My Future", starts as a slow synth ballad that "transitions into a laidback funk groove".
[31] Lyrically, the song is about self-discovery.
[31] "Oxytocin", the fifth track, has a techno pulse.
[15] The song references the titular hormone.
[32] The sixth track, "Goldwing", loops its a capella introduction throughout the song.
[15] The eighth track, "Halley's Comet", is a ballad featuring stripped-back vocals, light synths, and a backbeat.
[31] The ninth track, "Not My Responsibility", is a spoken word interlude with an ambient instrumental that debuted on Eilish's Where Do We Go?
World Tour (2020).
[15][32]

The interlude then transitions into the tenth track, "Overheated", which samples the production of its predecessor and explores stardom in the era of social media.
[15] The eleventh track "Everybody Dies", is a downtempo alt-pop ballad, driven by dark synths and light guitar strumming, with "Eilish's voice again standing out".
[31][33] The twelfth track, "Your Power", is a soft acoustic ballad about sexual abuse and being taken advantage of by your partner.
[34] The thirteenth track, "NDA" discusses the lack of privacy in her life due to her rise in fame over a dark electropop beat which transitions into the fourteenth track "Therefore I Am", which is lyrically about dismissing the haters and critics.
[35] The fifteenth track, "Happier Than Ever", is a rock opera song.
[36] It has been described as "a mopey breakup song", before breaking into "an electric-guitar-driven rager", while the rest of the tracks "bare different kinds of catharsis, teetering between sexy, electronic beats and warm folkiness, reminiscent of her earliest music.
"[8] It has been dubbed an album highlight.
[28][37] The album closes with "Male Fantasy", a slow-tempo ballad that finds Billie reflecting on relationships and sexual growth.
On April 26, 2021, Eilish began hinting at upcoming music, and revealed the title, Happier Than Ever, in an Instagram post on April 26, including a 15-second snippet of the title track, which had been previously teased in the documentary film.
[38][39] The following day, Eilish announced Happier Than Ever as the album title, after billboards announcing its title and release date reportedly began appearing in various cities.
[29][40][41][42] Happier Than Ever was released on July 30, 2021.
[43] It was available in a variety of physical album formats, such as eight differently colored vinyl LPs, including retail-exclusives for Amazon, independent record stores, Target, Urban Outfitters and Walmart, ten CD variants, including autographed CDs at independent stores, a version with alternate packaging hand-painted by Eilish, three premium box sets, a Target-exclusive edition packaged with a poster, and multiple cassette tape variants, including a deluxe box set.
[44]

[48] Next month, during the 30th anniversary of Interscope Records, the label announced a museum exhibit, Artists Inspired by Music: Interscope Reimagined, featuring new cover arts of the projects released by the label.
Those artworks were featured on the limited vinyl release.
[49] Happier Than Ever new cover was designed by American artist Lisa Yuskavage.
[50]

Eilish appeared on the cover of June 2021 issue of British Vogue, wearing a corset.
[51] The photoshoot provoked polarizing reactions.
[52] The singer also were interviewed for that magazine,[53] and also for such publications as the Guardian and Rolling Stone.
[54][8] To support the album in the United Kingdom, a television special titled Billie Eilish: Up Close was broadcast on BBC One on July 31, in tandem with Eilish's debut on the BBC Live Lounge.
[55][56] All of the album's tracks received lyric videos on YouTube upon its release.
[57] For the first anniversary of the album's release, Eilish shared voice memos of her recording takes for "Billie Bossa Nova", "Lost Cause", "Your Power", the title track, and "Male Fantasy".
[58]

Live performances
On June 16, 2021, Eilish performed a 27-minute set on Prime Day Show, including renditions of first four singles from Happier Than Ever, "All the Good Girls Go to Hell", and "Everything I Wanted".
[59] The set was later released on Amazon Music to download and streaming as a digital EP.
[60] The artist partnered with an American video hosting service Vevo to create a series of "Official Vevo Live Performances" in promotion of Happier Than Ever.
[61] Four renditions of the album's songs were published on the singer's official YouTube account; in chronogical order: "Your Power" on July 18,[62] "Male Fantasy" on August 4,[63] "Lost Cause" on October 21,[64] and "Billie Bossa Nova" on January 13, 2022.

[68] It was the third live concert performance from the album to ever be published on her channel, following "NDA (Live at Coachella)"[69] and "I Didn't Change My Number (Apple Music Live 2022)".
[70] The choice to record and publish the live version of the song performed in the country is likely related to Brazil's cultural influences on the song itself.

[122]

The final two songs of Happier Than Ever, namely the title track and "Male Fantasy", were chosen as the album's sixth and seventh singles, respectively.
Similarly to how the music video for "Bad Guy" was published on the same day as When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?

[128] Even though critically acclaimed, the song did not manage to appear on many charts.
[129] Both "Male Fantasy" and "Happier Than Ever" were performed by Eilish on Saturday Night Live on December 11.
[130]

Upon release, Happier Than Ever received critical acclaim from music critics, who admired its resolute portrayal of teenage stardom contrasting its muted sound.
[27] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from publications, the album has a weighted mean score of 86 based on 27 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".
[132]

NME critic El Hunt lauded the album for proving Eilish "one of her generation's most significant pop artists", and wrote that its music is "softer" and "far more low-key" than her debut record.
[28] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted the "uniformly great" melodies and vocals, the "less flashy" production in Happier Than Ever, observing a "more somber" tone.
[15] Sal Cinquemani of Slant felt the album is more "sonically diverse" than Eilish's debut record, expanding beyond its predecessor's trip-hop and trap elements.
[32] The Daily Telegraph's Neil McCormick dubbed Happier Than Ever "the sound of a tortured teen alone in her bedroom late at night", its lyrics "pithy", and Eilish's vocals "delicate".
[137]

Reviewing in his "Consumer Guide" column, Robert Christgau gave Happier Than Ever an "A" and applauded Eilish for conceiving original ideas about fame through "sheer candor", highlighting her lyrics on "Getting Older", "Not My Responsibility", and "Everybody Dies".
[30] Louis Bruton of The Irish Times stated the album describes "the confinements and exploitations of being a celebrity and a teenager.
"[21] Rob Sheffield, writing for Rolling Stone, called it a "downright heroic", "dark, painful, confessional album where [Eilish is] choosing not to settle into the role of America's beloved kooky kid sister.
"[136] David Smyth of Evening Standard complimented the style and non-mainstream appeal of the album's production.
[138] Clash's Robin Murray called Happier Than Ever "a work of subtle evolution" and "a record of quite complexity".
[139]

Variety's Chris Willman highlighted the album's "trenchant observation", "self-aware humor", and "post-celebrity self-consciousness".
[140] Sarah Carson of i labeled the album a "great, understated, philosophical" project inclining towards sparse and acoustic pop music trends.
[141] Jesse Atkinson of Gigwise called the album's production extraordinary, admiring its interpretation of music genres.
[142] Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen of The Sydney Morning Herald deemed the album a cohesive, "revealing and rewarding, listening experience" enhanced by Eilish's "acidic" delivery.
[143] In his Slate review, Carl Wilson liked the musical and lyrical maturity Eilish displays in Happier Than Ever.
[144] The New York Times' Lindsay Zoladz felt the album is "fixated on the tension between private and public knowledge, a social-media-era pop star's meditation on how much candor—if any—she owes her audience.
"[145]

A few reviews were critical of Happier Than Ever.
Alexandra Pollard of The Independent remarked that the album is "full of things most of us don't have to deal with", but Eilish turns them into relatable stories via "insightful" songs.
She dismissed the tracks "Oxytocin" and "Goldwing" as insubstantial.
[17] In a mixed review, Matthew Kent of The Line of Best Fit commended Eilish's lyrics and Finneas' production, but regarded the album a less unique work, with its tracks "often blurring into each other.
"[37] Consequence critic Mary Siroky, despite her overall warm review, also agreed that the album could be too cohesive with sonically indistinct songs.
[146] The A.V.
Club's Alex McLevy felt "there are just a few too many tracks on Happier Than Ever, which starts off unstoppably strong, but starts to falter in the back half.
"[25] Stereogum's Tom Breihan wrote negatively, calling the album a boring, "shell-shocked" product of Eilish's attempts at making a second album as triumphant as her first.

Title: Thinking Out Loud – Ed Sheeran (Wikipedia)  
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Out_Loud


"Thinking Out Loud" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran recorded for his second studio album, × (2014).
It was written by Sheeran and Amy Wadge, and produced by frequent collaborator Jake Gosling.
It was released in the US on 8 August 2014 as the album's third single.
In the UK, the song spent 19 weeks within the top 40 before peaking at number one in early November 2014; it became Sheeran's second number-one single there.
The single has also reached the top spot in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Denmark, the Netherlands, Slovakia and South Africa, and peaked at number two on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100.
It was Sheeran's highest-charting single in North America until "Shape of You" topped the charts in both countries in 2017.
In June 2015, "Thinking Out Loud" became the first single to spend a full year in the UK top 40.
In September 2015, it also became the seventh single to have achieved triple platinum certification in the UK during the 21st century.
In October 2015, the song became the first to be streamed over 500 million times on Spotify, is also one of the most streamed songs in the UK and has been viewed more than 3.8 billion times on YouTube as of February 2025.
[3]

"Thinking Out Loud" received nominations for Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 58th Grammy Awards, winning the latter two.
[4]

Background and Writing
Sheeran wrote "Thinking Out Loud" with Amy Wadge,[5] a Wales-based singer-songwriter.
He met Wadge when he was 17 years old and they had since written several songs together.
Of these, five songs composed the extended play Songs I Wrote with Amy,[6] which Sheeran independently released on 4 April 2010.
Wadge also co-wrote the song "Gold Rush", a track on the deluxe version of Sheeran's debut album, + (2011).
[5]

In February 2014, Wadge visited Sheeran at home for a "chilling-out time".
[5] Around that time, Sheeran's second studio album, ×, was nearly completed.
[7] Wadge revealed that her visit was not supposed to be a songwriting session.
[5] While Sheeran was taking a shower, Wadge played a few chords on a guitar.
The tune caught the attention of Sheeran and he ran downstairs.
Sheeran suggested working with the tune, but only after returning home from dinner, work began.
[5] The melody developed from a simple riff.
According to Sheeran, he composed the melody on a guitar in a manner which was "very Van-like", referring to Van Morrison.
The Irish musician has been an inspiration to Sheeran since a young age, and Sheeran wanted to capture that vibe when he composed the song.
[8]

In the kitchen,[9] Sheeran and Wadge began writing the song at 2:00 am on 4 February 2014, and completed it in 20 minutes.
[5] According to Wadge, the lyrical content resulted from her and Sheeran's talking about "everlasting love", inspired by the circumstances relevant at that time.
[10] Sheeran also revealed that the lyrics were inspired by his then-girlfriend, Athina Andrelos,[11] whom Sheeran met in early 2014.
Sheeran would later explain that he wrote the song "in a relationship at a really, really happy point".
[12] Sheeran revealed that he also had his grandparents in mind and maintaining love in old age ("'til we're 70" in the lyrics), and the early version of the chorus was "I'm singing out now" before it became "I'm thinking out loud".
[13] Immediately after writing, Sheeran recorded the song on his phone.
[5] He was keen to include "Thinking Out Loud" on the second album.
He properly recorded the song the following day at the Sticky Studios, a recording facility located in the small Surrey village of Windlesham, and informed Wadge of its inclusion on the album.
[5] It became the last song recorded for the album.
[5] For "Thinking Out Loud", Sheeran sought the assistance of Jake Gosling, who produced much of his debut album and had earlier contributed tracks, four of which appear on the standard version of the second album.
Composition
Thinking Out Loud" is a romantic ballad[14][15] with blue-eyed soul influences.
[1] Sheeran referred to it as a "walking down the aisle song".
[16] In the lyrics, Sheeran reflects on "getting older and fidelity and love in a fairly conventional context", according to Eric Clarke, professor of music at University of Oxford.
[17]

The song was composed in the key of D major with a tempo of 79 beats per minute.
[18] Sheeran's vocals range from B2 to A4.
[19] In the mix, Sheeran's voice is "unusually" loud over the instruments, which, for Mike Senior of the music technology magazine, Sound on Sound, is "surprisingly rare" in contemporary records.
[20] Senior analysed the vocal elements in which he found that, in spite of several notes sung off pitch, "the overall framework of the vocal remains fundamentally in tune".
[20]

Journalists noted similarities between "Thinking Out Loud" and "Let's Get It On", a 1973 single by soul musician Marvin Gaye.
Andrew Unterberger of Spin wrote that "the gently loping four-note bass pattern and crisp '70s soul drums absolutely smack of the Gaye classic, as do the embrace-insistent lyrics and general candlelit-bedroom feel".
[21] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard called it a "sleek update" of the classic.
[22]

Release
Prior to the album release, Sheeran debuted "Thinking Out Loud" on 24 May 2014 by performing it live on the British music television show, Later... with Jools Holland.
The debut followed the release of the video accompaniment to "Sing", the album's lead single.
"Thinking Out Loud" was immediately perceived as having contrast to "Sing", which is a "high-energy funk/R&B-infused song".
[15][23] "Thinking Out Loud" became available on 18 June 2014 as an "instant grat" download for consumers who pre-ordered × on the iTunes Store.
It served as a promotional single from ×, which was released two days later.
On the standard version of the album, "Thinking Out Loud" is the next-to-last track,[8] the last being "Afire Love".
"Thinking Out Loud" was initially serviced to Australian radio on 14 August 2014 and later released on 24 September 2014.
It served as the third of five singles released from the album; it followed the songs, "Sing" and "Don't", the first and second single respectively.
According to Sheeran, no one from his record label wanted to release "Thinking Out Loud" as a single, favouring over "Photograph" as the "big song".
[12] "Photograph" was supposed to be the main single, but when "Thinking Out Loud" spent several weeks within the top 20 on the UK Singles Chart albeit not receiving rotation,[24] the latter song was kept as the third single.
"Photograph" was later released as the fifth and final single.
"Thinking Out Loud" was issued on 7" vinyl exclusively as part of the Black Friday Record Store Day, which was celebrated on 28 November 2014.
[25] The vinyl record included, as a B-side, the live version of "I'm A Mess" which Sheeran performed at the Lightship 95 studio.
[26] On 26 December 2015, Sheeran released an Irish-language version of "Thinking Out Loud" for the Irish album CEOL 2016.
[27]

Critical reception
Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times noted that the "injection of blue-eyed soul" on the song is "enjoyable", and that it "makes Sheeran's aptitude for melody difficult to dismiss".
[28] Jim Beviglia of the American Songwriter thought that although "tidy", "Thinking Out Loud" comes "toothless" compared with the "daring confessionals" Sheeran made on the other songs.
[29]

The Washington Post writer, Allison Stewart, has hailed the song as "a blatant and mercilessly effective bid for 'I'll Be'-style wedding-song immortality".
[30] Billboard magazine's Jason Lipshutz, commented that Sheeran "pushes this bold stab at romance past its sappiest moments, and ends the album on a likable note".
[22] Jamieson Cox of Time wrote that "the album's greatest moment by a country mile is relegated to its penultimate slot", referring to "Thinking Out Loud".
[31]

Chart performance

[44] Sleep is one of the company's most popular categories that, according to Spotify, "people also use for general relaxation and to help themselves unwind".
[45][46] The Guardian columnist Tim Dowling suggested that the report indicated "very popular, slightly mellow songs that keep cropping up on sleep playlists" but not a list of a "carefully curated journey to unconsciousness".
[47]

In October 2015, "Thinking Out Loud" set the record of most streams of a song on Spotify, having accumulated over 500 million streams.
[48] The company created the "Sheerio Index", an interactive graphic map which showed where Sheeran was most popular.
The colour-based map indicated that Sheeran was most popular in Denmark.
[48] It was surpassed a month later by "Lean On", a song by Major Lazer and DJ Snake featuring MØ.
[49]

Music video
Emil Nava directed the video accompaniment to the single.
Most of it was filmed in the Crystal Ballroom at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, California.
The video was shot continuously using a 16 mm film camera.
[50]

Unlike Sheeran's earlier videos, where he assumed a low profile, he took the lead role on "Thinking Out Loud".
In the video, Sheeran executes a contemporary dance with Brittany Cherry, a contestant from the televised American dance competition, So You Think You Can Dance.
[51] The routine was choreographed by Nappytabs and with training help from Paul Karmiryan.
While on concert tour, Sheeran spent five hours a day for three weeks to practice with Cherry.
[12]

The video was released on 7 October 2014.
After the first 24 hours, the video had over 2.7 million views on video-sharing website, YouTube.
[51] As of October 2022, it has 3.5 billion views,[52] making it the 17th most viewed video on the site.

[60]

Parodies and usage in media
On 28 April 2015 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, actor Jeremy Renner, known for his role as Hawkeye in the Avengers movies, performed on piano and sang a song captioned by Fallon's show on YouTube as "Hawkeye Sings About His Super Powers".
While not parodying Sheeran's lyrics, it is sung to the same tune.
The lyrics suggest that Hawkeye feels defensive compared with the other Avengers as he was the only mortally human one in a team of superhuman or enhanced heroes: "But listen, I've got powers too; they're pretty sweet.
/ I promise I can do so much more than just archery ... / I can open a pickle jar.
/ I'm friggin' Hawkeye.
/ Maybe I'm as super as they are.
"[61]

The song and video were also parodied in the CW series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.
Titled "Let's Have Intercourse", the song was sung by Scott Michael Foster with Rachel Bloom appearing in the scene dancing with Foster in the same manner as Sheeran and Cherry.
The lyrics are an appeal by Foster's character, Nathaniel Plimpton III, to series protagonist Rebecca Bunch (Bloom) to have sex whilst trapped in an elevator.
[62]

Plagiarism allegations
Further information: List of songs subject to plagiarism disputes
On 10 August 2016, it was announced that the family of Ed Townsend, who co-wrote Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On", was suing Sheeran, alleging that "the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic compositions of 'Thinking' are substantially and/or strikingly similar to the drum composition of 'Let's [Get It On]'.
"[63] The case was dismissed without prejudice in February 2017.
[64] Two years later, on 28 June 2018, Ed Sheeran was again sued on similar grounds, this time for $100 million in damages by Structured Asset Sales, owners of one-third of the copyright to "Let's Get It On".
[65] The case was heard by a jury in New York City in 2023, which found in favor of Sheeran.
[66][67]

Sheeran's defence rests on the argument that, while the two songs have similar "building blocks" and a specific chord progression in particular, such features are true for many pop songs.
[68] After winning the trial, Sheeran said: "These chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before 'Let’s Get It On' was written and will be used to create music long after we are all gone.
"[69]

In June 2025, the US Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from Structured Asset Sales ending the legal dispute.

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_(BTS_song)

"Dynamite" is a song recorded by South Korean boy band BTS, released on August 21, 2020, through Big Hit Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment.
It is the band's first song fully recorded in English.
[3] The song was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar and produced by Stewart.
[4] It has been described as an upbeat disco-pop song[1] with elements of funk, soul, and bubblegum pop, and takes influence from 1970s music—it features snapping handclaps, echoing synths, and celebratory horns.
Intended to soothe listeners during the COVID-19 pandemic, the song talks about joy and appreciation for the little things that make life valuable.
Upon release, "Dynamite" received positive reviews from music critics, with praise towards its catchiness and broadly appealing retro sound.
It garnered the band their first Grammy nomination, for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making them the first Korean pop act to be nominated for one.
"Dynamite" experienced large amounts of commercial success worldwide; it debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the band's first number-one single in the United States and making BTS the first all-South Korean act to top the Hot 100.
The song sold 265,000 downloads in its first week, marking the biggest pure sales week since Taylor Swift's "Look What You Made Me Do" (2017).
"Dynamite" stayed atop the Hot 100 for three total weeks.
On Spotify, "Dynamite" debuted with 7.778 million streams, marking the biggest opening day for a song in 2020.
Additionally, "Dynamite" peaked at number one on both the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl.
U.S. charts, topping the latter for three consecutive weeks.

The accompanying music video reached 1 billion views on April 12, 2021.
Initially a standalone single, "Dynamite" was later included on BTS's fifth Korean-language album, Be (2020), released on November 20.
[5]

Recording
"Dynamite" is one of the few songs to which the members did not contribute in songwriting or production.
[6] In interviews with multiple media outlets, writers David Stewart and Jessica Agombar explained the song's creation.
[7][8][9] Through their publisher Tim Blacksmith at Stellar Songs, they learned that BTS was searching for an English language single.
[7][8] The duo wrote three songs over Zoom calls "at the start of lockdown.
"[8][9][10] Stewart and Agombar wanted to create a song which was "energetic, fun, hopeful, positive and just like a huge ball of energy."
Agombar disclosed how the song was conceived:

"It needs to be explosive" -- and obviously explosive then became "Dynamite."
Any kind of word like that...
I'm always thinking of fireworks, or "Firework," because I'm a massive Katy Perry fan.
I just wanted anything high-energy.
It wasn't a particular lyric, it was a bundle of ideas: explosive, fireworks, dynamite, party, fun, energetic, worldwide takeover.
[...] So it just had to match the energy of everything surrounding BTS.
It was less a line than a feeling.
The BPM had to be quick, we have to have horns, it has to be uptempo.
[8]

Stellar Songs sent the track to Columbia's CEO Ron Perry and Big Hit in early April.
[8][9] BTS initially chose another song, before taking "Dynamite" two weeks later.
[10] The songs lyrics were tweaked alongside Jenna Andrews to make them more PG friendly.
Stewart told E!
Online that the group and labels "wanted to make sure it was quite neutral and not offensive" and that "There was a couple of rap references that might've been a bit more just like in your face and a bit more like, you know, ballsy that wasn't quite right for them".
[10] The song was ultimately recorded in mid-July.
[8][9]

Lyrics and production
Dynamite" is a 1970s-influenced disco-pop song[11][13][14] with elements of funk, soul[15] and bubblegum pop.
[16] Sheet music for the song shows a 4
4 common time in the key of E major with a tempo of 114 beats per minute.
The vocal range spans from B3 to D♯5.
[17] Instrumentation was provided by Stewart, who played drums, percussion, bass guitar, synth bass, synthesizers, pads, piano, electric guitars, programmed horns and programmed strings, and Johnny Thirkell, who played live horns.
[18][19] The upbeat production consists of "snapping" handclaps, bounces, grooves and "infectious" beats.
[20][21] The track features a funky bassline accompanied by vocal harmonies, falsetto hooks and a disco rhythm that is "ready-made for the dancefloor.
"[12] It utilises "layered vocals, echo-y synth, and celebratory horns" to recreate the '70s retro sound.
[11]

The song opens with a snippet of the chorus, where Jungkook sings, "'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight/ So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight."
Percussion and bass is added in the next section.
It further builds with Nile Rodgers-esque guitar that is later boosted by "vibrant" brass sound.
[20] The chorus is "unifying" and gains speed as the song progresses.
[22] Craig Jenkins of Vulture compared the horns in the chorus to that of Neon Genesis Evangelion's theme song, "A Cruel Angel's Thesis" (1995) and described "Dynamite" as "a vehicle expressly designed to break through the stratosphere", noting its similarity in genre to the handful of other disco-influenced songs that reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 earlier that year (namely Doja Cat's "Say So", Harry Styles' "Watermelon Sugar", and Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande's "Rain on Me").
[23] Pitchfork's Noah Yoo compared the song musically to Taio Cruz's 2010 song of the same name.
[24] The last two verses of the track introduce a change in the key.
[25][22] Speaking about the meaning of the song in a press conference, Suga stated that "Dynamite" has a "message of confidence and happiness.
It's like after you fell on the ground, you're trying to get back up again.
That's what this song is like.
"[26] In an interview with Zane Lowe of Apple Music, RM said the song is "made of positive vibes, energy, hope, love, the purity, everything.
"[27] Lyrically, the song talks about the joy and appreciation of little things that makes life valuable.
[28][29][30] The lyrics also include several pop cultural references including King Kong, The Rolling Stones and basketball star LeBron James.
[21][25][24] Alyssa Bailey of Elle interpreted the lyrics as "a much-needed burst of joy and invitation to join them, dance, and be a light, even when the world seems a little dark".
[31]

Release
On July 26, 2020, the band confirmed during a live stream on V Live that they would be releasing an English-language song on August 21, 2020, as the first single for their upcoming album.

Title: What Makes You Beatiful – One Direction (Wikipedia)  
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Makes_You_Beautiful

"What Makes You Beautiful" (often abbreviated as WMYB) is the debut single by the British-Irish boy band One Direction.
It was the lead single from their debut album, Up All Night (2011).
Written by Savan Kotecha and producer Rami Yacoub, the song was released by Syco Records on 11 September 2011.
The uptempo power pop[1] track features a prominent guitar-based chorus and riff.
The middle eight consists of a "na na na" hook.
"What Makes You Beautiful" was a commercial success, reaching number one in several countries.
It has been certified quadruple platinum in the US with sales of 4.8 million copies as of June 2016.
[3] The single peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the UK Singles Chart.
The song won the 2012 Brit Award for British Single of the Year and was generally complimented by contemporary music critics, who highlighted the appeal to the teenage audience and the pop sensibility.
It debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart after setting a Sony Music Entertainment pre-order record and selling 153,965 copies in its first week.
The single topped the Irish and Scottish Singles Charts, and reached the top ten on the Australian and New Zealand Singles Charts, Flemish Ultratop 50, Canadian Hot 100, and the Japan Hot 100.
The song's accompanying music video, directed by John Urbano, was uploaded to YouTube on 19 August 2011.
It depicts One Direction spending time on a beach in Malibu, California.
The video garnered three MTV Video Music Awards at the 2012 ceremony.
One Direction performed the song live on televised shows, at awards ceremonies, and on all four of their headlining concert tours: Up All Night Tour (2011–12), Take Me Home Tour (2013), Where We Are Tour (2014), and On the Road Again Tour (2015); band member Harry Styles performed the song on his 2017 and 2021 solo tours.
Many artists have covered the song, including the Piano Guys, Boyce Avenue, and Enhypen.
It is often regarded as One Direction's signature song, and one of the most iconic and recognisable pop songs of the 2010s.
Background and production
"What Makes You Beautiful" was written by Savan Kotecha and Carl Falk and produced by Yacoub and Falk.
Instrumentation was completed by Falk and Yacoub.
Serban Ghenea handled the audio mixing, Tom Coyne the audio mastering, and John Hanes the mix engineering, for which Phil Seaford served as the assistant.
[4] Discussing the song's conception, Kotecha said:

I had the melody of the chorus in my song for about a year until I was in a hotel room in London with my wife and she was having a bad morning.
She was like, "Oh, I feel so ugly" and I was like, "No, you look beautiful.
You don't know how beautiful you look."
And I was like, "Oh, crap!
That's a good song!
Hold on!"
And I wrote that down.
I actually wrote the song for my wife, so I went to the studio and it took a process of a couple weeks to really tweak it, but the core of it was written within two days and then tweaked a few things here and there over a couple weeks, but I mean, I still have the text message from Harry [Styles].
When he heard the demo, I was in Miami on my way back to Sweden, and he sent me a text message saying, "I think you got it.
I think you got the one here.
"[5]

After recording the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden,[4] the band felt relieved to have a song that they were happy to release as their debut single.
Band member Liam Payne called the song "perfect",[6] and Harry Styles said, "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single.
"[7] Styles spoke to MTV News, "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun.
It kind of represented us, I think it took us a while to find it but I think we found the right song."
Payne added, "We always wanted [the single] to be something that people didn't expect and then when we heard it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly.
"[8]

Release and promotion
"What Makes You Beautiful" premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 10 August 2011,[7] and was released by Syco Music in Europe, Australia and New Zealand via digital download on 11 September 2011.
[9] A CD single was released in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2011,[10] and followed in Australia and Germany on 25 November 2011 and 2 December 2011, respectively.
[11][12] In North America, the single was released in Canada via digital download on 31 January 2012.
[13] It was issued 14 February 2012 in the United States[14] and was sent by Columbia Records to US contemporary hit radio (CHR) playlists on 28 February 2012.
[15]

For the North American release of Up All Night on 13 March 2012, Columbia Records executives used social media to shape the marketing campaign.
Columbia Records co-chairman Steve Barnett and his team decided to reverse the usual pattern of releasing a single on radio.
Instead the label mounted a four-month marketing campaign aimed at building a fan base through social media before a single was ever released or played on the radio.
The social media campaign asked fans to sign petitions and to enter video competitions to win a concert in their town.
The campaign was a success as One Direction's Facebook followers in the United States rose from 40,000 to 400,000.
As a result, "What Makes You Beautiful" sold more than 131,000 copies in its first week, even though it had yet to be played on the radio.
Radio programmers were flooded with calls from fans.
Johnny Wright, who managed New Kids on the Block, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, said: "Now they are calling the radio station, and the radio station is scratching its head, saying, "We don't even have that record yet".
It's almost like the return of the Beatles.
I call it hype, but it's positive hype because it's all real.
It's not manufactured.
No one paid these kids.

Title: LOve Story – Taylor Swift (Wikipedia)  
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Story_(Taylor_Swift_song)


"Love Story" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.
It was released as the lead single from her second studio album, Fearless, on September 15, 2008, by Big Machine Records.
Inspired by a boy who was unpopular with her family and friends, Swift wrote the song using William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet as a reference point.
The lyrics narrate a troubled romance that ends with a marriage proposal, contrary to Shakespeare's tragic conclusion.
Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, the midtempo country pop song includes a key change after the bridge and uses acoustic instruments including banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and guitar.
At the time of the song's release, music critics praised the production but deemed the literary references ineffective.
In retrospect, critics have considered it one of Swift's best singles.
"Love Story" peaked atop the chart in Australia, where it was certified fourteen-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and reached the top five on charts in Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
In the United States, the single peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first country song to reach number one on Pop Songs.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it eight-times platinum.
"Love Story" has sold over six million copies in the United States and 18 million copies worldwide.
Trey Fanjoy directed the accompanying music video, which stars Swift and Justin Gaston as lovers in a prior era.
Drawing from historical periods such as the Renaissance and the Regency era, it won Video of the Year at both the Country Music Association Awards and CMT Music Awards in 2009.
The song became a staple in Swift's live concerts and has been a part of the set lists in all of her headlining tours from the Fearless Tour (2009–2010) to the Eras Tour (2023–2024).
Following a 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded the song and released it as "Love Story (Taylor's Version)" in February 2021.
The track topped the Hot Country Songs chart and made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to top that chart with both the original and re-recorded versions of a song.
Background and writing
Taylor Swift moved from Pennsylvania to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2004 to pursue a career as a country singer-songwriter,[2] and in 2006, she released her first album Taylor Swift at 16 years old.
[3] The album spent more weeks on the US Billboard 200 chart than any other album that was released in the 2000s decade.
[4] Taylor Swift's third single "Our Song" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single.
[5] Her success was rare for a female teenage artist; the 2000s country-music market had been dominated by adult male musicians.
[6][7]

While promoting her debut album on tour in 2007 and 2008, Swift wrote songs for her second studio album Fearless.
[8] She developed "Love Story" late into the production of Fearless.
[9] Answering fan questions on Time in April 2009, Swift said the song was inspired by a boy whom she never dated and was one of the most romantic pieces she had written.
[10] Swift recalled the reactions she received after introducing him to her family and friends: "[They] all said they didn't like him.
All of them!
"[11][12] This made Swift relate to the narrative of William Shakespeare's 16th-century play Romeo and Juliet, which she described as a "situation where the only people who wanted them to be together were them".
[11] Reflecting on the event, Swift thought, "This is difficult but it's real, it matters"; she developed the second refrain and later the whole song around that line.
[13]

Although inspired by Romeo and Juliet, Swift felt the play could have been "the best love story ever told" had it not been for Shakespeare's tragic ending in which the two characters die.
[14] She thus made the narrative of "Love Story" conclude with a marriage proposal, which she deemed a happy ending the characters deserved.
[14][15] Swift wrote "Love Story" on her bedroom floor in approximately 20 minutes, feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished.
[11] According to Swift, the song represents her optimistic outlook on love, which is inspired by her childhood fascination with fairy tales.
[15] Looking back on "Love Story" after she released her seventh studio album Lover (2019), which is about her first experience of "love that was very real", Swift said the track is "stuff I saw on a movie [and] stuff I read mixed in with some like crush stuff that had happened in my life".
[16]

Production and release
After finishing writing, Swift recorded a rough demo of "Love Story" within 15 minutes the next day.
[10] She recorded the song's album version in March 2008 with the producer Nathan Chapman at Blackbird Studio in Nashville.
[17] For her vocals, Chapman tried different microphones until Swift came across an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone that was built by the country-music artist Ray Kennedy, with whom she worked on Taylor Swift.
After growing fond of the Avantone CV-12 upon testing her vocals, Swift used it to record "Love Story" and other songs.
She sang the song live backed by her band, who were playing acoustic guitar, bass guitar, and drums.
Chapman played other instruments, including nine acoustic guitars, and he overdubbed them on the track; he also recorded background vocals.
[17] The engineer Chad Carlson recorded the track using Pro Tools and Justin Niebank mixed it using a Solid State Logic 9080 K series console and Genelec 1032 studio monitors.
[17] Drew Bollman and Richard Edgeler assisted in the mixing process.
[18]

"Love Story", along with the rest of Fearless, was mastered by Hank Williams at MasterMix Studios in Nashville.
[18] The track uses country-music instruments such as banjo and fiddle.
Big Machine Records released it to US country radio as Fearless's lead single on September 15, 2008.
[17][19] Chapman mixed another version of "Love Story" for pop radio; he edited Niebank's mix using Apple Logic and muted the acoustic instruments such as banjo and fiddle.
[17] The pop-radio version has an opening beat that was generated using Apple Logic's Ultrabeat, and the electric guitars were created with Amplitube Stomp I/O.
[17] Rolling Stone's Keith Harris described the electric guitars as "suitably gargantuan" and louder than those on the country-radio version.
[20] Big Machine in partnership with Republic Records released "Love Story" to US pop radio on October 14, 2008.
[21] In the United Kingdom, "Love Story" was released on March 2, 2009, a week prior to the release of Fearless.
Music Week reported that this edition was "remixed for European ears".
[22]

Music and lyrics
"Love Story" is a midtempo country pop song[23][24] that is driven by acoustic instruments including banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and guitar.
[25] Jon Bream from the Star Tribune described the single as "pure pop with a minimalist vibe" that suits both country and pop radio.
[23] According to The New York Times, despite the banjo and fiddle, the song could "easily be an emo rocker".
[26] Swift's vocals have a slight twang.
[27] The mix and master, according to Billboard's Kristen He, are loud and "dynamically flat ... [and are] designed to burst out of FM radio speakers".
[25]

The lyrics of "Love Story" narrate a troubled romance between two characters, drawing from the lead characters in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.
[28] According to the psychologist Katie Barclay, the song explores feelings of love in the contexts of pain and joy.
[29] "Love Story", save for the final refrain, is narrated from Juliet's perspective.
[1][30] In the verses, Juliet tells the story of hers and Romeo's challenged courtship, of which her father disapproves.
[31] The first verse introduces Juliet in a scene, "We were both young when I first saw you / I close my eyes and the flashback starts, I'm standing there / On a balcony in summer air", which references the balcony scene in Act II, scene ii of Shakespeare's play.
[1] In the refrains, which alter slightly as the song progresses to accompany the narrative, Juliet pleads for her love interest to appear, "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone / I'll be waiting / All there's left to do is run.
"[29][30]

In the second verse, Juliet meets Romeo again in a garden and learns he must leave town because of her father's disapproval.
[10] Their relationship encounters difficulties, "'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter", referencing Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (1850).
[32] According to the media-and-film scholar Iris H. Tuan, Hawthrone's "scarlet letter" imagery represents the female protagonist Hester Prynne's sin and adultery, whereas Swift's use symbolizes the forbidden love between Romeo and Juliet.
[32] Juliet pleads, "This love is difficult, but it's real", which Swift said was her favorite lyric in the song.
[33]

After the bridge, with accelerated drums and the harmonization of melody and vocals, the final refrain incorporates a key change up a whole step.
[34] The final refrain is narrated from Romeo's perspective and tells of his marriage proposal to Juliet after he has sought her father's approval, "I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress.
"[35] Whereas Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet are secretly married without their parents' approval and both commit suicide, the characters in "Love Story" depart from that ending.
[36] According to Tuan, by projecting her feelings and fantasy on a Romeo and Juliet-inspired narrative, Swift created a song that strongly resonates with an audience of teenage girls and young women.
[37] Deborah Evans Price of Billboard agreed but also said "one doesn't have to be a lovestruck teen" to enjoy the song's emotional engagement.
[38]

Critical reception
Blender included "Love Story" at number 73 on its 2008 year-end list,[39] and The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop critics' poll placed it at number 48.
[40] In Fearless reviews, many critics complimented the production; Sean Daly from the St. Petersburg Times,[41] Rob Sheffield from Blender[42] and Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic selected the track as an album highlight.
[43] Deborah Evans Price of Billboard praised the "swirling, dreamy" production and said Swift's success in the country-music market "could only gain momentum".
[38] Others including The Boston Globe's James Reed[30] and USA Today's Elysa Gardner deemed "Love Story" an example of Swift's songwriting abilities at a young age; the latter appreciated the song for earnestly portraying teenage feelings "rather than [being] a mouthpiece for a bunch of older pros' collective notion of adolescent yearning".
[44]

Some critics were more reserved in their praise and took issue with the literary references.
In a four-stars-out-of-five rating of the song for the BBC, Fraser McAlpine deemed the Shakespearean reference not as sophisticated as its premise and the lyrics generic, but he praised the production and wrote, "It's great to see a big pop song being used as a method of direct story telling.
"[28] The musicologist James E. Perone commented: "the melodic hooks are strong enough to overcome the predictability of the lyrics.
"[45] Jon Bream from the Star Tribune deemed the single inferior to Swift's debut country-music single "Tim McGraw" (2006) but commended the production as catchy.
[23] In a Slant Magazine review, Jonathan Keefe was impressed by Swift's melodic songwriting for creating "massive pop hooks" but found the references to Romeo and Juliet "point-missing" and The Scarlet Letter "inexplicable".
Keefe deemed the lyrics lacking in creativity and disapproved of Swift's "clipped phrasing" in the refrain.
[46]

In retrospective commentaries, the English-language professor Robert N. Watson and the music journalist Annie Zaleski deemed "Love Story" a memorable song thanks to its Shakespearean narrative; the former regarded it as an evidence of Swift's status as "the twenty-first-century's most popular songwriter of failed love affairs"[47] and the latter wrote that the song deserves to be "a love story for the ages".
[48] "Love Story" was included on best-of lists including Taste of Country's "Top 100 Country Songs" (2016),[49] Time Out's "35 Best Country Songs of All Time" (2022),[50] and Billboard's "Top 50 Country Love Songs of All Time" (2022).
[24]

Critics have rated "Love Story" high in rankings of Swift's songs; these include Hannah Mylrea from NME (2020), who ranked it fifth out of 160 songs,[51] Jane Song from Paste (2020), 13th out of 158,[52] and Nate Jones from Vulture (2024), 11th out of 245.
[53] In another ranking of Swift's select 100 tracks for The Independent, Roisin O'Connor placed "Love Story" at number 15 and said it showcases Swift as a songwriter who "understands the power of a forbidden romance".
[54] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian placed it second, behind "Blank Space" (2014), on his 2019 ranking of Swift's 44 singles.
He said of the literary references: "[If] the references to Shakespeare and Hawthorn seem clumsy, they are clumsy in a believably teenage way.
"[55]

Commercial performance

[61] It became the first song to top both the country-radio and pop-radio charts and surpassed the number-three-peaking "You're Still the One" (1998) by Shania Twain as the highest-charting country crossover to pop radio.
[62]

On other Billboard airplay charts, "Love Story" peaked at number one on Adult Contemporary and number three on Adult Pop Songs.
[63][64] Together with "Teardrops on My Guitar" (2007), "Love Story" made Swift the first artist in the 2000s decade to have two titles each reach the top 10 of four airplay charts; Hot Country Songs, Pop Songs, Adult Pop Songs, and Adult Contemporary.
[65] It topped the 2009 year-end Radio Songs chart.
[66] By February 2009, it was the first country song to sell three million downloads.
[67] In 2015, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified "Love Story" eight-times platinum.

[90]

Music video
Development and filming
Trey Fanjoy, who had worked with Swift on previous music videos, directed "Love Story".
[91] Swift was inspired by historical eras such as the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Regency to make a period-piece-styled video with a timeless narrative that "could happen in the 1700s, 1800s, or 2008".
[91] She spent six months searching for the male lead and upon recommendation from an acquaintance chose Justin Gaston, a fashion model who was competing in the television series Nashville Star.
[92][93] After Gaston was eliminated from the show, Swift contacted him to appear in the video.
[91] She believed Gaston was a perfect choice for the male lead: "I was so impressed by the way his [expressions] were in the video.
Without even saying anything, he would just do a certain glance and it really came across well.
"[92]

The music video was filmed within two days in August 2008 in Tennessee.
The crew considered traveling to Europe to find a castle for the video's setting but settled on Castle Gwynn in Arrington; the castle was built in 1973 and is part of the annual Tennessee Renaissance Festival.
[91] Wardrobe for the video—except Swift's dress for the balcony scene, which was designed by Sandi Spika with inspiration and suggestions from Swift—was supplied by Jacquard Fabrics.
[91] On the first day, the balcony and field scenes were filmed.
The second day's filming included the ballroom scene was filmed with 20 dancers from Cumberland University in Lebanon; Swift learned the choreography 15 minutes prior to filming.
[91] She invited some fans who were university students from other states to fly to Nashville and film the video with her.
[94] "Love Story" premiered on September 12, 2008, on CMT.
[95] Behind-the-scenes footage of the music video's production was aired on Great American Country on November 12, 2008.
[96]

Synopsis and commentary
The video starts with Swift wearing a black sweater and jeans; she walks through a college campus and sees Gaston reading under a tree.
As they make eye contact, the video transitions to a balcony, on which Swift is wearing a corset and gown.
The video switches to a ballroom where Gaston and Swift dance together, after which Gaston whispers into Swift's ear.
Swift is next shown walking into a garden with a lantern at night.
She meets with Gaston and they have a date before parting ways.
Later, Swift again stands on the balcony looking out from the window.
She sees Gaston running across a field towards her and she immediately runs down the staircase to meet him.
The video then switches back to the modern-day college campus, where Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, and the video ends.
[91]

Spin wrote that the video appears to have been filmed on an "HBO-looking budget" with "elaborate, pseudo-medieval set pieces"; according to the magazine, rather than alluding to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, the narrative resembles "Rapunzel", especially the part in which Swift's character waits for her lover atop a castle.
[97] According to Glamour, Swift's fashion in the video reinforces the lyrical theme, "[She] literally wore a medieval ball gown while playing the Juliet to an actor's Romeo.
"[98] In a 2010 Billboard interview, Swift reflected on the video's fairy-tale-inspired wedding setting: "I'm not really that girl who dreams about her wedding day.
It just seems like the idealistic, happy-ever-after [moment].
"[99]

Written by Adele and the album's producer, Greg Kurstin, "Hello" is a piano ballad with soul influences (including guitar) and lyrics that discuss themes of nostalgia and regret.
Upon release, the song garnered critical acclaim, with reviewers comparing it favourably to Adele's previous works and praised its lyrics, production and Adele's vocal performance.
It was recorded in Metropolis Studios, London.

In the United States, "Hello" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, reigning for ten consecutive weeks while becoming Adele's fourth number-one single on the chart and breaking several records, including becoming the first song to sell over a million digital copies in a week.
By the end of 2015, it had sold 12.3 million units globally (combined sales and track-equivalent streams) and was the year's 7th best-selling single while it stands as one of the best-selling digital singles of all-time.
[3]

The accompanying music video was directed by Xavier Dolan and co-stars Adele and Tristan Wilds.

[9]

Writing and composition
"Hello" was written by Adele and Greg Kurstin and produced by Kurstin, who also played bass, guitar, drums, piano and keyboards, while Adele played drums.
[11] "Hello" was written in Chiswick, London, something not normally done by Adele, who said she likes to write her music at home.
[12] The writing process for the song was slow, taking six months to complete.
Initially Adele and Kurstin started writing the first verse; finishing half of the song, six months later Adele contacted Kurstin to finish the song with her, with Kurstin stating he was not sure "if Adele was ever going to come back and finish it.
"[13]

"Hello" is a soul piano ballad,[2][14] played in the key of F minor at a tempo of 79 beats per minute.
The repeated chord progression heard in the verse, played by the piano, follows two progressions and a passage (Bridge) progression (passage or Bridge progression connects two main progressions to each other) of Progression #1: Fm(i)–A♭(III)–E♭(VII)–D♭(VI), Passage progression: Fm(i)–E♭(VII)-Cm(v)-D♭(VI)-Fm7(i7)-E♭(VII)–D♭(VI), Progression #2:Fm(i)–D♭/F(VI)–A♭(III)–E♭(VII).
According to Musicnotes.com, Adele's vocals span from F3 to A♭5 in the song.
[15] During the chorus, Adele is heard singing the lines over layers of backing vocals, piano and drums which were described by The Daily Telegraph as having "a very luscious wall of sound".
[10]

Lyrically, the song focuses on themes of nostalgia and regret, and was seen as a follow-up to her single "Someone like You" appearing to reflect on a failed relationship.
The song's lyrics were also seen as being conversational, revolving around "all the relationships of her past", ranging from friends, family members and ex-partners.
[16] Speaking on the song's lyrical content, Adele told Nick Grimshaw on The Radio 1 Breakfast Show: "I felt all of us were moving on, and it's not about an ex-relationship, a love relationship, it's about my relationship with everyone that I love.
It's not that we have fallen out, we've all got our lives going on and I needed to write that song so they would all hear it, because I'm not in touch with them.
"[17] According to Adele, the line "Hello from the other side" signifies "the other side of becoming an adult, making it out alive from your late teens, early twenties.
"[13]

Release
On 18 October 2015, a 30-second clip of "Hello" was played during a commercial break on The X Factor in the United Kingdom.
The commercial teased what was then new material, with her vocals accompanied by lyrics on a black screen.
[18] Josh Duboff of Vanity Fair wrote that "the Internet collectively lost their minds" after the broadcast of the trailer.
[19] On 22 October, Adele announced the upcoming release of 25 to her fans on Twitter.
She also shared that "Hello" would be released on 23 October as the lead single off of the album.

[23][24]

Critical reception
"Hello" received universal critical acclaim.
[25][26][27][28] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described it as "a big ballad, but a superior example of its kind", and opined that the song is "precisely the kind of lovelorn epic ballad that made Adele one of the biggest stars in the world.
"[29] Writing for The Independent, Emily Jupp stated in her review of the song that it "might not be groundbreaking, but Adele's return with her familiar, smoky sound is very welcome".
She called it an "'if it ain't broke' ballad" and said: "Adele does what she does best, belting out emotional tales of love and loss much the same as with her last album, 21, but this time, with a little more self-forgiveness.
"[30]

Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote: "Lyrics that work best when they zoom in on personal details match her combination of vocal power and restraint.
"[31] Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph called it "a beautiful song of loss and regret", adding that "it takes a grip on the kind of memory every listener holds somewhere in their heart and merges it with Adele's own drama.
"[10] Rolling Stone ranked "Hello" at number 6 on its year-end list to find the 50 best songs of 2015.
[32] Several publications have commented on similarities in the theme of the song and accompanying video with that of "Hello" by American singer Lionel Richie.
[33][34]

In 2021, Parade ranked the song number 12 on their list of the 25 greatest Adele songs,[35] and in 2022, American Songwriter ranked the song number three on their list of the 10 greatest Adele songs.

Music video
"When I heard the song I saw a story right away.
[The video] is highly unoriginal.
The lyrics are 'Hello, it's me' and then you see someone picking up a phone.
I'm not good at imagining super conceptual videos.
I just thought it would be nice to have her walk around the house and make phone calls and end up in a forest, with maybe some flashbacks in it."
— Xavier Dolan, behind the concept of the music video[89]
The accompanying music video for "Hello" was directed by Canadian actor and filmmaker Xavier Dolan and released on 23 October 2015, despite the fact the song was released as a single a day later.
[90][91] The concept of the video revolves around a recently broken-up young woman calling a younger version of herself.
[89] Portions of the video—mostly the finale on the pond and the shot of her opening her eyes in the beginning—were filmed with IMAX cameras, making it the first music video in IMAX format.
[92] The video draws inspiration from Dolan's semi-autobiographical debut I Killed My Mother, which was made when Dolan was barely 20.
[89] The video was filmed on a farm in Quebec over four days in September 2015.
[89]

The video stars American actor Tristan Wilds.
According to Dolan, Adele called him after an unspecified incident of police brutality in the United States, suggesting that a white male not be cast as her love interest in the video.
Dolan elaborated "She was just like, 'I'm concerned with the reality of the tensions between authorities and the black community, and I want to send a message out there.
'"[93][94] Dolan contacted Wilds via Skype and explained the concept for the video, which Wilds agreed to take part in.
[95] During the filming, both Adele and Wilds were asked to improvise and "tap into" their past relationships to convey the correct emotions.
Dolan also filmed shots of both Adele and Wilds having conversations and laughing.
[95] The sepia toned video shows Adele performing the song in a small house and outside in a wooded forest, intercut with scenes of her making a tearful phone call and flashbacks to a past relationship with Wilds' character.
[96]

The flip phone used by Adele in the video was widely commented upon due to being of a retro style.
Dolan replied to the remarks by saying: "It makes me uncomfortable filming iPhones because I feel like I'm shooting a commercial.
Those things: iPhones, laptops, all those elements, to me, they bring me back to reality: That's not what you want.
You want to get out of your own life; you want to enter someone else's; you want to travel somewhere; you want to be told a story.
I'm realizing maybe I've been more distracting than anything else with that flip phone, but it wasn't intentional!
"[97]

The music video for "Hello" broke the previous Vevo Record by achieving over 27.7 million views within its first 24 hours of release.
This record was previously held by the music video for Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood", which had amassed 20.1 million views in its first 24 hours.
[98] Later, the video continued to break Miley Cyrus' "Wrecking Ball" Vevo record for the fastest video to reach 100 million views in five days.
[99] The phrase "Adele hello" was also the top YouTube search term of Friday and Saturday, and on average the video was getting one million views per hour during the first two days, peaking at 1.6 million in a single hour, beating the peak view rate of the trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which peaked at 1.2 million views per hour.
[100] The video was parodied in a Thanksgiving-themed sketch on Saturday Night Live.
[101]

The video peaked as the 30th most viewed video on YouTube in 2020,[102] having earned over 2.8 billion views, as well as the 26th most liked video on the platform in 2015, with over 17 million likes.
[103][104] The video holds the Guinness world record for the "fastest time for a video to reach 1 billion views" in 87 days.

Background and writing
"Baby" was written by Bieber with Christopher "Tricky" Stewart (who worked on Bieber's debut single "One Time"), R&B singer The-Dream and his then-wife, Christina Milian, as well as Def Jam label-mate and the songs co-performer, Ludacris.
[4] When asked how the collaboration initially came about, Bieber said, "[Ludacris and I] both live in Atlanta.
I met him a year prior to this and we figured it was a perfect collaboration for him, so we invited him out to do it."
A few days before the release of the single, Bieber posted an acoustic version of the song to his YouTube with his guitarist Dan Kanter, similar to the way he did with "Favorite Girl".
Billboard said that: "Bieber delivers his characteristically clean vocals with conviction: "My first love broke my heart for the first time / and I'm like, 'baby, baby, baby, no!'
I thought you'd always be mine.
"[5] Also in a review of the acoustic version Bill Lamb of About.com said that, "I think the vocals here will convince some that Justin Bieber really does have the vocal chops.
"[6]

Style and composition
The song is predominantly upbeat, featuring Bieber's R&B vocals over a backdrop containing a dance infused beat, full of keyboard and "disco string" synths.
[7] The song is played at a tempo of 130 BPM and is composed in the key of E♭ major with Bieber's vocal range spanning from the low-note of G3 to the high-note of C5.
[8][9] According to Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, the song "blends winks at Fifties doo-wop with hip-hop chants", comparing the style and the lyrics "My first love broke my heart for the first time/And I was like/Baby, baby, baby, oh/I thought you'd always be mine" to fifties ballads like "Tears on My Pillow", "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" and "Earth Angel".
[9] Lyrically, Bieber's lines explain his distress over his lost love, and promise to get it back, featured in lines like, "And I wanna play it cool/But I'm losin' you…/I'm in pieces/So come and fix me…".
[7] The chorus features the distinct and repetitive hook mainly consisting of the lines "[Like] baby, baby, baby, oh" and "Baby, baby, baby, no".
After the second verse, Ludacris comes in with the verse-rap, an anecdote of young love when he was thirteen, as it runs "When I was 13/I had my first love/She had me going crazy/Oh, I was star-struck/She woke me up daily/Don't need no Starbucks…".
[10]

Critical reception
Nick Levine of Digital Spy felt the song was "no great departure from what he's given us before", but felt the production of Tricky and The-Dream helped give the song a "simple", "big" chorus about "puppy love" that works.
[11] Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard said, "The midtempo number's undeniably contagious chorus should keep Bieber's tween fan base satisfied, and Ludacris' brief cameo adds a welcome urban twist.
"[12] Bertoli went on to say, "The matchup adds a layer of maturity to Bieber's repertoire and should further solidify his growing presence on the charts.
"[12] Rap-Up magazine said that "the sweet pop fare gets a little street cred courtesy of the teen sensation's labelmate Ludacris.
"[13] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone appreciated the song's vintage doo-wop and fifties aesthetic and hip-hop chants, and said the song included "one of the catchiest choruses concocted by the-Dream and Tricky Stewart, the duo behind "Umbrella" and "Single Ladies".
[9] Luke O'Neill of Boston Globe had mixed thoughts about the song calling Ludacris' cameo "goofy", and said, the song "effects a musical anachronism, albeit a catchy one, but in this sped-up recycling moment all styles all at once are grist for the mill.
"[14]

Chart performance
In the United States, "Baby" debuted at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Bieber's highest-charting single in the US.

[27] It was filmed at Universal CityWalk and Lucky Strike Lanes, by director Ray Kay, who had previously directed videos for Beyoncé Knowles, Lady Gaga, Alexandra Burke, and Cheryl Cole, among others.
[28] Ludacris said that the video "is like a 2010 version of Michael Jackson's "The Way You Make Me Feel"."
Bieber said that the video "will capture the song's message of trying to woo back a girl.
"[29] In explaining the concept of the video, Bieber said, "It starts off, I really like this girl, but we didn't [get] along; we couldn't be together.
Basically I want her back and [I'm] kind of going through the whole thing.
I'm chasing her around, trying to get her, and she's kind of playing hard to get, but I'm persistent.
I keep going.
"[29] The video premiered exclusively on Vevo on Friday, February 19, 2010.
[30] Singer and actress Jasmine Villegas portrays Bieber's love interest in the video.

[29]

The video takes place in a mall-like setting with a bowling alley and more.
After the video was released, MTV commented on the video being the new version of "The Way You Make Me Feel" saying, "... and the choreography does use a few of Jackson's less-suggestive moves.
"[34] The MTV review goes on to say, "most of the video takes place in the bowling alley, there are also scenes of Bieber in other settings, hanging out with Luda, doing the moonwalk, messing with his hair and mugging for the camera.
During the video Bieber's friends and Villegas's friends have several dance offs and Villegas eventually smiles at him.
Regardless of his crush's apparent frustration with him, Bieber eventually wins her over.
The video concludes with the pair walking off into the night holding hands.
"[34]

Billboard reviewed the video, saying, "Those new dance moves he's showing off can only mean one thing: all over the world, tweens' hearts are melting right now.

She opted to incorporate choreography into performances of the song, inspired by artists such as Britney Spears.

Gomez performed the song on numerous occasions while promoting her second studio album, Revival (2015).

Background and release
Norwegian producers Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, better known as Stargate, both produced and wrote the song along with Ester Dean.
[1] Dean recorded a demo of the song, which was originally written for inclusion on Barbadian artist Rihanna's sixth studio album, Talk That Talk (2011).
[2] Rihanna ultimately decided not to record the song, thus it was given to Gomez for inclusion on Stars Dance.
[3] Gomez later spoke to Billboard on the collaboration with the trio, claiming "I'm a huge Stargate fan – I think their beats and what they produce is just gold [...] And Ester Dean is just an incredible vocalist that a lot of people know, but if you actually hear her voice just solely on her own, it's just stunning, and it's really haunting.
"[4] "Come & Get It" was one of the last songs to be recorded for the album, which was completed in February 2013.
[4] While recording the song, Gomez knew she wanted it to be the lead single, stating "I just remember recording it and being in the studio and just thinking of how the place I was in and what I was going through and I was just so excited about it and I wanted it to be the first single.
"[5] Gomez shared a similar sentiment in a later interview as well, adding "The reason I wanted it to be the first single was because radiates, as I said before, trust and out and that's something I'm willing to share with the world.
This is the place I want to be and want to represent something good and be a good example, so I think it's fun.
"[5]

Prior to the announcement of the single, it was speculated that Gomez had collaborated with her friend Taylor Swift on the lead single to her upcoming album; Gomez denied this.
[6][unreliable source?]
Gomez first announced "Come & Get It" in March 2013, and confirmed an April 8, 2013 release date.
[7] Following the announcement, pieces of the song's single cover began being posted on Gomez's official website and social media;[8] the cover was released in full on March 27.
[9] Philippe Bond and David Bond, also known as The Blonds, designed the costumes and clothing adorned by Gomez for the cover of the single.
[10] The pair stated "Working with Selena Gomez and her stylist Basia Richards is always an amazing experience [...] Selena's style is what The Blonds are all about.
It's daring, glamorous, and always fun!
"[10] She later uploaded an eleven-second teaser for the song on April 1, with yet another teaser following on April 4.
[11][12] "Come & Get It" was leaked online on April 6,[13] leading to the track being released for digital download a day prior to what was initially planned.
[14][15] On Air with Ryan Seacrest later began streaming the song earlier than initially planned due to the unexpected leak.
[16] Gomez released an extended play featuring six remixes of the song to digital retailers on May 28, 2013.
[17]

Production and lyrics
"Come & Get It" is an electropop,[18] dance-pop and bhangra song[19] that lasts for a total of three minutes and fifty-one seconds.
[20] The song is composed in the key of G minor[21] and features a moderate tempo of 80 beats per minute.
[22] Gomez's vocal range spans from the low tone of F3 to the high note of D5.
[23] The song opens with a "Bollywood inspired" theme,[24] before transitioning into a more dubstep influenced sound.
[24] Gomez said the song was inspired by works from pop singer Britney Spears and Skrillex, the latter of which worked on the soundtrack to the film Spring Breakers (2013), starring Gomez.
[25] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy said the song featured a "dirty, fuzzy bassline" and "grinding beats and one-night-stand synths" before comparing it to recent releases by Rihanna.
[26] MTV also compared it to work by Rihanna and stated the song was a "whirling mix of tablas and robo-vocals.
"[27] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone said the song was an "unimpeachably catchy big-pop stomp, with come-hither lyrics and a string of moody vocal hooks.
"[28]

The song helped Gomez develop a more mature image than she had in the past.
[29] Gomez stated that she had hoped to "create something fun, sassy, and playful, but unexpected" with the song.
[30] Lyrically, the song speaks of Gomez's desire to rekindle a former romance, claiming she is willing when he is ready to "come & get it".
[31]

Controversy
"Come & Get It" drew some criticism from listeners, some of whom found the song to be anti-feminist.
New Zealand recording artist Lorde praised the song "on a sonic level", but added "I'm a feminist and the theme of her song is, 'When you're ready come and get it from me.'
I'm sick of women being portrayed this way.
"[32] Songwriter Amy S. Foster felt similarly, adding "It's not the idea that she is having sex, or singing about sex or wearing sexy clothes that bothers me.
It's the fact that she sings quite proudly about being a total doormat with the notion that THAT is sexy.
"[33]

Critical reception
Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly described it as "an easy, breezy tune with an ambling melody and a hint of reggae lilt.
"[34] Bradley Stern of MuuMuse.com also praised the song, stating that "'Come & Get It' is fairly monotone, but repeat listens reveal the song's infectiousness: The chorus – especially with that stuttered chant at the end – is pure sticky pop goodness, the stomping beat is smutty enough to inspire a sick strut, and that whirring Bollywood-meets-tribal-electro synth sound lends itself well to some grind-up-against-the-wall make-out action up in the club.
"[35] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote, "As the bhangra music-inspired intro merges into a dirty, fuzzy bassline, it's clear from the off Selena has ditched the pop sheen she has become known for.
"[36] Corner later gave the song three out of five stars.
[36] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the song three and a half stars, writing, "Call it Gomez's Justin Bieber breakup song if you want.
The more accurate description, though, is 'Rihanna-wannabe anthem.'
Stargate and Ester Dean, the team behind some of Rih's biggest smashes, have given Gomez the good stuff"[28] Newsday gave Stars Dance a somewhat negative review, though listed "Come & Get It" and "Slow Down" as highlights of the project.
[37] AllMusic praised the song and stated that "the tablas add a nice mystical touch" to the track.
[38] The Boston Globe praised the song in their review of Stars Dance, and positively compared it to releases from Rihanna.
[39] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian praised the song, and compared it to releases from Miley Cyrus.
[40] Sputnikmusic praised the "bass drop" in the song, and listed "Come & Get It" and "Birthday" as the highlights of the album.
[41]

Common Sense Media gave the song two stars, claiming that "While the beats are infectious, Gomez just doesn't have the vocal chops to hold up during the verses, and mostly just sounds sleepy.
"[42] Billboard gave the track a mixed review, and negatively compared it to her prior single "Love You like a Love Song" (2011).
[43] Slant Magazine criticized both the song and its parent album, even accusing Gomez of cultural appropriation, claiming "The tabla-infused lead single 'Come and Get It' exhibits similar issues, emptying its Indian influences of any apparent meaning by treating them as mere sonic decoration.
"[44] The Los Angeles Times wrote "[Stars Dance's] productions are rooted in today's pop-EDM default mode, but as that stuff goes, 'Slow Down' is pretty capable, and the bhangra-appropriating 'Come & Get It' is guilelessly silly enough to work.
"[45] Ron Harris with Yahoo!
Music gave Stars Dance a negative review, though wrote that "Gomez's lead single and Billboard top 10 hit, the catchy "Come & Get It," is about the best offering here, thanks to Stargate's club-heavy beat.
"[46]

[80] The dress was designed by Aadnevik.
[81]

She later added "And that [black] dress was actually a last-minute dress because I was wanting it to be more long-sleeved.

I get it: it's a beautiful dress and I definitely love the pop with my hair.
"[80] Gomez released a teaser for the video on April 30, showing the singer in a large field surrounded by flowers, looking longingly at a mysterious man, plunging into a river, and performing a choreographed dance routine with a group of dancers in front of a fire.

[86] Images of Gomez dancing in front of a fire and seducing a man are interspersed between shots of an eagle, thunder, and waves of the ocean.
[86] Gomez is again shown lying in the field as the camera zooms out, and an oncoming storm is shown.
[87] Once the music begins to play, a number of Indian men are seen playing the tabla.
[87] Wearing a red chiffon Marco Marco ensemble with sleeves and a flowing bottom, Gomez begins to perform a choreographed dance routine with several backup dancers.
[86] The group perform the routine in front of a large fire, symbolizing the fire portion of the classical elements.
[87] Gomez begins to sing and roam through the field in a black corset dress.
[86] She is then seen in the same field with a wall of mirrors, and begins to dance and pose in the mirrors while the sun reflects off of the glass.
[86]

She is again shown flirting with the mysterious man, who is never directly shown though only seen in glimpses.
[86] Gomez can next be seen running to a large area covered in boulders, symbolizing the earth portion of the elements.
[87] For this scene, Gomez dons a long, sleeveless white dress with a plunging neckline.
[86] The dress features multiple layers, with Gomez shaking the dress and her hair with the wind.
[86] With the beginning of the second verse, Gomez can be seen sticking her head out from a body of water, thus symbolizing the element of water.
[87] A seemingly topless Gomez sings the song while remaining in the water, before floating down the stream.
[86] She can later be seen completely submerged in the water, looking off into the distance as pieces of a long dress she is wearing float around her.
[86] While Gomez completes the choreography with her dancers, the music ends.
[87] Selena is then seen swaying in the field as the storm passes on.
[87]

Live performances
Gomez performed "Come & Get It" for the first time at the 2013 MTV Movie Awards on April 14, 2013.
[88][89] During the performance, Gomez performed the choreography from the song's music video, citing artists such as Britney Spears as an influence on her performance.
[88] The performance was praised by critics, with MTV writing "Selena's new single is a confident mantra, and her "Come & Get It" Movie Awards performance saw the singer making good use of her husky alto while tackling complex Bollywood-inspired choreography for a more mature moment that felt less Disney schoolgirl and more tempting seductress.
"[90] Spears herself also praised the performance.
[91] Gomez made her network television premiere of the song on the April 16 episode of The Ellen Degeneres Show.
[92][93] That night, Gomez performed the song on Dancing with the Stars, using the same choreography as her MTV Movie Awards performance.
[94] During these performances, Gomez donned a bindi, and later came under fire for her use of the religious symbol.
Hindu statesman Rajan Zed claimed "[The bindi] is also sometimes referred to as the third eye and the flame, and it is an auspicious religious and spiritual symbol...
It is not meant to be thrown around loosely for seductive effects or as a fashion accessory aiming at mercantile greed.
"[95][96][97][98] Gomez defended her decision to wear the bindi, claiming "I think the song has that Hindu, tribal feel and I wanted to translate that.
I’ve been learning about my chakra and bindis and the culture — it's beautiful.
"[99]

On April 24, Gomez appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman where she again performed the song.
[100] She later performed both "Come & Get It" and "Love You like a Love Song" on MTV Upfronts.
[101] On April 27, Gomez performed the song at the 2013 Radio Disney Music Awards, continuing to use the choreography and wear the bindi during the performance.
[102] The performance was praised by the media, with Hollywood Life writing "In a blue-hued checker dress that seemed to be made partly out of party streamers and a brand new bindi (because a girl can never own too many bindis), Selena owned the stage while tons of fans screamed along in awe.
"[103] On May 19, 2013, she performed the song at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards.
[104] Of the performance, MTV wrote "Gomez was the first performer of the night, setting the tone.
She kept the Bollywood theme of her MTV Movie Awards performance in a flowy dress with a gold metal bustier and bindi, sensually dancing to her latest single.
"[105] During a promotional press tour in the United Kingdom, Gomez appeared on The Graham Norton Show, her first European performance of the song.
[106] Gomez appeared on the Macy's 4th of July Fireworks, where she performed both "Come & Get It" and "Slow Down".
"Come & Get It" was one of five songs performed by Gomez for Walmart Soundcheck, with the performances being included as bonus tracks on the Walmart deluxe edition of Stars Dance.
[107]

Gomez was one of several artists to perform at the iHeartRadio Coca-Cola Summer Concert Series, where she performed "Come & Get It" along with other songs from the album.
[108] On July 17, Gomez appeared on the United Kingdom television program This Morning.
To promote the release of the album, Gomez performed "Come & Get It" along with "Birthday" and "Slow Down" on Good Morning America on July 26.
[109] The performance aired as part of the show's annual summer concert series.
[109] The song was featured in the encore of Gomez's Stars Dance Tour, which launched in Vancouver on August 14, 2013.
She continued the choreographed routine for performances of the track during the tour, with Idolator writing "She tapped into the song's middle eastern flavor with the choreography and reminded everyone why it was one of the best songs of the summer.
"[110] "Come & Get It" was once more performed on November 28 during the Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving Halftime Show.
[111] Gomez performed the song as the final portion of a medley featuring "Like a Champion" and "Slow Down".
[111] The song was added to the set list of Gomez's iHeartRadio Jingle Ball performances, along with four other songs.
[112] Gomez performed the songs using a hand-held microphone in a red "floor-length, lacy gown".
[113] On October 12, 2015, Gomez performed "Come & Get It" for the first time in over a year while promoting her second studio album, Revival (2015).
[114] The performance saw Gomez singing a remixed version of the song as part of a medley with "Me & the Rhythm".

Title: See You Again – Charlie Puth feat.
Wiz Khalifa (Wikipedia)  
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_You_Again

"See You Again" is a song by American rapper Wiz Khalifa featuring American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth.
Produced by Puth, DJ Frank E and Andrew Cedar, who also co-wrote the song with Khalifa, the song was commissioned for the soundtrack of the 2015 film Furious 7 as a tribute to Fast & Furious actor Paul Walker, who died in a single-vehicle crash on November 30, 2013.
The song was released on March 10, 2015, as the soundtrack's lead single.
It was later included as a bonus track on the international release of Puth's debut album, Nine Track Mind (2016).
"See You Again" became both artists' biggest single to date.
It spent 12 non-consecutive weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100, tying with Eminem's "Lose Yourself" for the second longest-running rap number-one single in the country behind Lil Nas X's "Old Town Road", and topped the UK Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks.
[2] It also reached number one in several other countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and Switzerland.
The song held the record for the most-streamed track in a single day on Spotify in the United States, until it was surpassed by One Direction's "Drag Me Down".
[3] It set the record for most streams in a single week worldwide, and in the United Kingdom also in a single week.
The music video was the most-viewed video on YouTube from July 10 to August 4, 2017.
"See You Again" received three nominations at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Song Written for Visual Media.
It was also shortlisted for the Song of the Year for the BBC Music Awards and was nominated for Best Original Song at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.
[4] "See You Again" was the best selling-song of 2015 worldwide, with combined sales and track-equivalent streams of 20.9 million units according to IFPI.
[5] It is certified Diamond by the RIAA,[6] and is one of the most-streamed songs on Spotify ever, with over 2.1 billion streams.
[7]

Writing and development
"See You Again" was written by DJ Frank E, Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa, and Andrew Cedar.
It was produced by DJ Frank E, Charlie Puth, and Andrew Cedar,[8] with mixing provided by Manny Marroquin.
Frank E and Puth were approached by their publishing company, Artist Publishing Group, to develop a melody that could pay tribute to actor Paul Walker for the film Furious 7 (2015); Artist Publishing Group then set up a first-time studio session for Puth with DJ Frank E at a studio in Los Angeles.
[9]

Puth, talking about the first studio session for the song, said that when he went to the studio "[the producers] were working on this song" and it already had the "See You Again" chords, but it was a "synthy" production for a "dance song", and he later suggested the idea of the song being a piano ballad instead.
[10] Puth said that he became emotionally attached while writing the lyrics of the track, recalling Vail Cerullo, a friend of Puth's from his time at Berklee College of Music, who died in a motorcycle accident in 2012.
[11][12] Puth and DJ Frank E's output from the session was well received by Furious 7 filmmakers, Universal Pictures, and Atlantic.
As a result, the track was further commissioned to include rapped verses based on the subject of family, combined with Puth's vocals and a piano melody.
The song then went through an extensive note-giving and production process.
[13] Before choosing Wiz Khalifa's version, several other rappers were offered to record the rapped parts of the song, including Eminem, 50 Cent and Tyga.
[14][15][16] Puth said that he was initially reluctant to let the film's soundtrack label, Atlantic Records, choose his vocals for the song.
In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Puth recalled, "It just seemed to occur from out of nowhere.
And basically 10 minutes later Justin (Franks [DJ Frank E]) and I wrote it, we sent it off, and I thought we'd never hear about it again".
[13] Puth revealed on The Howard Stern Show that Atlantic originally wanted to get a more established singer to sing his part, having Chris Brown, Sam Smith, Jason Derulo and others recording their own versions of the song's chorus.
Puth stated that also British singer Adele "wanted to cut it".
According to Puth, "none of the vocals had the [right] feeling ... What I was singing about specifically, you just couldn't hear it in their voice.
I think Chris Brown got the closest to it, but they ended up, lucky me, going with my vocal".
[10][17]

The song was chosen to be played at the end of the film.
After Brian O'Conner's retirement send-off, the song can be heard as Brian and Dominic Toretto drive on a mountain road, parting ways as they reach a fork.
[13]

Title: Viva La Vida – Coldplay (Wikipedia)  
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_la_Vida

"Viva la Vida" (/ˈviːvə lə ˈviːdə/, Spanish: [ˈbiβa la ˈβiða]; Spanish for 'long live life' or 'live life')[4][5][6] is a song by British rock band Coldplay.
It was written by all members of the band for their fourth album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008).
The lyrics contain historical and Christian references (King Louis XVI of France and the French Revolution, "Roman cavalry choirs", Saint Peter) and the track is built around a looping string section with a digitally processed piano, while other layers are gradually added.
The track was first made available as part of the album pre-order on 7 May 2008, being released individually on 25 May 2008 as the album's second single.
Debuting to critical acclaim and commercial success, "Viva la Vida" reached the top spot of the UK Singles Chart and Billboard Hot 100, becoming the band's first number-one single in both the U.S. and U.K.
The song also won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in 2009.
Background
The song's Spanish title, "Viva la Vida", is taken from a painting by 20th-century Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.
In Spanish, viva translates to "long live",[7] so "Long Live Life" is an accurate translation and the painting reflects the artistic irony of acclaiming life while suffering physically.
[8] When asked about the album's title, referring to Frida Kahlo's strength, enduring polio, a broken spine, and a decade of chronic pain, lead singer Chris Martin said: "She went through a lot of pain, of course, and then she started a big painting in her house that said 'Viva la Vida', I just loved the boldness of it.
"[9]

During the album's production, "Viva la Vida" was one of the songs that had polarised each member's opinion over which version they should choose.
In an interview, Martin recalled: "We did quite a few different versions and went round the houses a bit and eventually settled on those treatments for it.
"[10]

Composition
The lyrics to "Viva la Vida" are narrated by a protagonist who says he "used to rule the world".
Martin has explained the song lyric "I know Saint Peter won't call my name" in an interview with Q magazine: "It's about ... You're not on the list" to enter the pearly gates.
[12] When asked about the song, bass guitarist Guy Berryman said: "It's a story about a king who's lost his kingdom, and all the album's artwork is based on the idea of revolutionaries and guerrillas.
There's this slightly anti-authoritarian viewpoint that's crept into some of the lyrics and it's some of the pay-off between being surrounded by governments on one side, but also we're human beings with emotions and we're all going to die and the stupidity of what we have to put up with every day.
Hence the album title.
"[13]

The song is written in the key of F minor.
Its main chord progression is D♭5/E♭7/A♭/Fm.
The time signature is 4
4 and the tempo is 138 beats per minute.
Unlike the then-typical arrangement of Coldplay songs, in which either the guitar or piano is the prominent instrument, the track mostly consists of a string section and a digital piano playing the song's upbeat riff, along with a steady bass drum beat, percussion (including a timpano and a church bell), bass guitar, and Martin's vocals; there is limited use of electric guitar.
All the strings are arranged and conducted by violinist Davide Rossi, who is one of the main collaborators of the album.
Rossi's strings comprise the main driving force throughout the song, with a strong beginning loop that supports Martin's voice, until the choruses where the symphonic power of the orchestra takes its fullest shape.
The prominent chords played by the string section throughout the song (and in the chorus of "Rainy Day", another of the band's songs) are very similar to those used by "Viva la Vida" co-producer Brian Eno in his piece "An Ending (Ascent)", meaning they could have been suggested partially for the song by Eno.
[14]

Release and promotion
"Viva la Vida" was first made available on the iTunes Store on 7 May 2008.
[15] The song was part of the pre-order marketing for Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, which also included exclusive acoustic versions for "Lost!"
and "Lovers in Japan".
[16] On 25 May 2008, Coldplay released it for individual purchase globally.
[17] However, since the track was already being given away as a free download to those who had pre-ordered the album, it remained ineligible for the UK Singles Chart until 12 June 2008.
[18] Parlophone originally requested the band to not release "Viva la Vida", arguing it "did not sound like Coldplay", but drummer Will Champion insisted on the release.
[19]

It became the best-selling song of 2008 on iTunes and was used as part of Apple's iPod + iTunes advertisement campaign.
[20][21][22] Coldplay first performed "Viva la Vida" live at the MTV Movie Awards.
[23][24] It has since gone on to make many media appearances, including being featured throughout the episode "A Person of Interest" from the paranormal drama Medium, as a song played on the radio in the episode "We're Not in Kansas Anymore" from the teen drama 90210,[25] and on the international soundtrack to the Brazilian soap opera A Favorita which helped push the track up the charts in Brazil, where the telenovela had been shown.
[26]

In 2009, Solange Knowles covered "Viva la Vida".
[27] Lady Gaga also covered it for BBC Radio 1.
[28] Live versions have appeared on the 2009 live album LeftRightLeftRightLeft,[29] the 2012 album Live 2012, and the 2018 album Live in Buenos Aires.
It was also used in "Million Dollar Maybe", an episode of The Simpsons.
The song was covered in the seventh series of The X Factor by the boyband One Direction in 2010.
In 2024, the season 2 finale of Pachinko ends with a cover by Rosé of the Korean pop group Blackpink.
[30]

Music videos
The official music video for "Viva la Vida" was directed by Hype Williams and premiered at Coldplay's official website on 1 August 2008, and was later released on 4 August 2008 on YouTube.
[31] The video depicts the band performing against a blurry, warped version of Eugène Delacroix's painting La Liberté guidant le peuple, ending with the band members crumbling into rose petals.
[32]

A second, alternate video was shot in The Hague, the Netherlands, directed by Anton Corbijn and released alongside the first.
[33][34] This second version is a tribute to Corbijn's video for Depeche Mode's "Enjoy the Silence" and portrays Chris Martin as the king from whose perspective the song is sung.
During the video, he carries Delacroix's painting.
At the end, he hangs the picture up in a white stall on top of a hill.
As he sings the last chorus, his bandmates surface heading his way, tying in loose ends from the "Violet Hill" video.
Critical reception
"Viva la Vida" received widespread critical acclaim.
In the Entertainment Weekly review of the album, critic Chris Willman wrote: "Take the title track ... on which [Martin] imagines himself as a paranoid monarch.
'Who would ever want to be king?'
Martin asks.
'Revolutionaries wait/For my head on a silver plate!'
The confident majesty of the music, however, belies how he and his bandmates have invigorated their rock-lite reign.
"[20] Josh Hathaway from The Plain Dealer noted "Viva la Vida" as the "catchiest" song on the album.
[35] Chris Jones of the BBC noted: "The string/brass mutations that bolster a track like 'Viva la Vida' ... conjure tunes so sweetly melancholy.
"[36] In the IGN review, critic Chad Grischow wrote, "It is their one and only foray into unabashed orchestral pop, but the punchy strut of the strings and fantastic marching vocals make it far too charming and lively to dislike, and even harder not to love.
"[37]

"Viva la Vida" was nominated for "Record of the Year", and won "Song of the Year", and "Best Pop Performance by a Duo or a Group" at the 2009 Grammy Awards.
[38][39] This song also won the Ivor Novello Award for "Best Selling British Single".
[40] The song was included in Rolling Stone's annual "100 Best Songs" of 2008 at number nine;[41] it was also voted number two on Rolling Stone's Readers' Rock List: Best Songs of 2008.
[42] "Viva la Vida" was also listed at number five on Blender's 1001 Downloads: The Top 144 Songs of 2008,[43] as well in the number eight position on Village Voice's Pazz and Jop list.
[44] "Viva la Vida" has been sampled in several other songs, including Flo Rida's "Be on You", Mac Miller's "Cut the Check" featuring Chief Keef and Drake's "Congratulations" from his So Far Gone mixtape.
In 2019, Billboard ranked the song number seven on their list of the 50 greatest Coldplay songs.
[45] In 2021, American Songwriter placed the song at number one on their own version of the ranking.
[46]

Chart performance
Driven by digital sales,[61] "Viva la Vida" became Coldplay's first song to top the Billboard Hot 100 and their second to enter the Top 10, following "Speed of Sound".
[62] It was also the first single from a British act to reach number one in the United Kingdom and United States simultaneously since "Maggie May" by Rod Stewart in 1971.
[63] The track later peaked at number eight on the Hot 100 Airplay, giving the group their highest-charting release in American radio.
[64] "Viva la Vida" topped Billboard's Modern Rock and Hot Adult Top 40 charts as well,[65] becoming the first single in Capitol history to achieve the feat on the latter.
[66]

Despite being disqualified from British rankings at first due to album pre-order restrictions on iTunes, the song eventually debuted atop the UK Singles Chart, making it Coldplay's first track to do so.
[67] In June 2024, PPL ranked "Viva la Vida" as the band's most played song across radio and television in the United Kingdom, averaging 27 reproductions a day since release.
[68] A year later, the track was placed at number 159 on the list of most streamed songs of all time on Apple Music.
[69]

In Canada, the single made a "Hot Shot Debut" at number four on the Canadian Hot 100 on the May 24 issue, making it Coldplay's highest debut there.
[70] It is also one of Coldplay's three highest-charting singles in Australia, reaching number two (both "A Sky Full of Stars" and "Something Just Like This" matched this peak in 2014 and 2017, respectively).
In the week starting 27 November 2023, the single once again returned to the same charts, entering at number 28.
[71] In New Zealand, the song was less successful, peaking at number 16; however, the song stayed in the top 40 for 27 non-consecutive weeks.
In Spain, the single peaked at number two and had strong airplay on the Spanish radio stations.

Plagiarism allegations
Coldplay were first accused of plagiarism for the melody of "Viva la Vida" by American band Creaky Boards.
[75] Singer Andrew Hoepfner, claimed that Martin had heard them playing their piece "The Songs I Didn't Write" at a live show in October 2007.
[76] They also published a video comparing sections of both tracks.
[76] A spokesperson for Coldplay stated that Martin was working at AIR Studios in London at the time.
[77] Additionally, a demo of "Viva la Vida" was recorded in March 2007.
[76] Creaky Boards later retracted the accusations and speculated that both songs may have been inspired by the video game The Legend of Zelda.
[77]

In December 2008, American guitarist Joe Satriani filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Coldplay in Los Angeles.
[78] It declared that "Viva la Vida" incorporates "substantial, original portions" of his composition "If I Could Fly", from Is There Love in Space?
(2004).
[79] The band denied the allegation, saying the similarities were entirely coincidental.
[80] The case was later dismissed by the California Central District Court,[81] with each party paying their own costs.
[82]

In May 2009, British musician Cat Stevens stated that "Viva la Vida" is similar to "Foreigner Suite" (1973), comparing them after talking with his son about it.
[83] Stevens informed that any legal action he intended to take depended "on how well Satriani does".
[83] In June 2009, he claimed that "They did copy my song but I don't think they did it on purpose [...] I don't want them to think I am angry with them.
I'd love to sit down and have a cup of tea with them and let them know it's okay".
[84]

In a documentary for Sveriges Television (2011), American music professor Dr. Lawrence Ferrara showed that the melody structures of "Viva la Vida", "If I Could Fly" and "Foreigner Suite" were all similar to the track "Se Tu M'Ami", which has its authorship attributed to Italian composers Alessandro Parisotti and Giovanni Battista Pergolesi.
[85][86] The latter died in 1736.
[87] "Obviously this is a work that we would call in the 'public domain'", Ferrara concluded.
[86] Discussing the accusations, drummer Champion stated that "We're confident we haven't done anything wrong" and "for some reason, God only knows why, the successful songs seem to be the ones that are accused of being stolen".
[88] Martin later revealed that the plagiarism allegations were inspiring to him: "If everyone's trying to take away our best song, then we'd better write 25 better ones".
